<!-- SQL Database Management and Analysis for "Student Market" Supermarket -->

<!--Business Goals
● Get the Employees, Students, Faculty/staff data. Data includes Name, ID,
DOB, phone number, SSN(only for employees).
● In what day of the week and hour are the most and least transactions done -
to get to know the maximum and least sales hours and give discounts so as
to
○ increase sales in those hours. Also we will be increasing labor at the
peak hours to address the huge crowd.
● Determine what percent of students and faculty are availing the student
and faculty discounts so that we can give more offers/discounts to attract
more customers. Check the total percentage of students in student
customers who have purchased commodities with and without discount(on
a scale of 100) and vice-versa. We will also determine if we need to
increase or decrease the discount percentage based on this information.
● Check the “Media” that has promoted our business. Find out the Media that
has the highest number of occurrences in the “Media” Column.
● Determine the average rating of the store using the “rating” column
in Customer Details. This can be used to advertise or attract
customers in future.
● Quarterly revenue model
1. Most sold item - has highest/more transactions of all the items purchased
in the quarter
2. Least sold - has lowest transactions of all the items purchased in the
quarter
3. Item count (sold) per month and quarter
● Check whether discounted product sales have increased in the offer period
● Check if new customers have joined for every end of the quarter to measure
the business performance
● Check for the payment method(Cash/Card) customers are more preferring to
use so as to increase the self-checkout or cash counters at the store.
● Check products from which vendors are being most sold and
increase/decrease the inventory
